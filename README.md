# ChiCross

**ChiCross** is a mobile logic game in which the player, following the hints on top and to the left of the grid, determines which tiles are supposed to be marked to uncover a hidden Chinese character. The game is based on the rules of [picross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram). In terms of technicalities, the project is powered by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 

## Features

* Collectible language cards with Chinese characters, their pronunciation and examples of usage acquired by beating levels.
* Multiple themes, customizable defeat conditions and more.
* Saving progress locally and (optionally) in Firebase using Google account.
* English and Polish language versions available.
